			"lyrics": "It's been a while, and I've been alone And you've been the only thing I've known Born in the South, at home in the North We could be anywhere you want Now you're taking me down where you grew up I wish I had known you when we were young You figured me out, I know I've said it enoughBut waiting is just too much So cover my skin with your sunkissed light There's a bonfire burning tonightWe could be all right Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline Picture it now, down the roadOh just say the word and I'll go Wherever you are, whatever the coastYou are the one I care for the most Remember the night we slept on the roof? I didn't sleep much to tell the truthNow we're the sand caught in the tide We laugh until we cry Won't you cover my skin with your sunkissed light There's a bonfire burning tonightWe could be all right Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline Pull me closer, hold me tighter The nights are long but the stars are brighter Pull me closer, hold me tighter Take me down, take me down, take me down Won't you cover my skin with your sunkissed light There's a bonfire burning tonight We could be all right Evaline, Evaline, Evaline, Evaline"

			"lyrics": "Oh and if you believe me when I say You’re not so different now We’ll stop this little game and save ourselves But ever since the day I started burning out Well I know that you’re the one that I’ve been dreaming about Won’t you take my hand, like I know you will When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight Don’t you understand that I need you still When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight And if you could take another breath And hold your head up, love I swear that I will come back from this one And if we fall asleep in the backseat of your car We’ll wake up in the snow and bury all our trouble Won’t you take my hand, like I know you will When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight Don’t you understand that I need you still When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight So stand by, someday we'll call out, and hold it together Stand by, someday we'll call out, can’t you hold it together Stand back, someday, call out Won’t you take my hand, like I know you will When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight Don’t you understand that I need you still When you’re sparkling madly in the moonlight"

It's so hard to get away Would you give me a sing? Don't you give me your lies The way you say my name It's so hard to get away Won't you give me a sing? Don't you give me your lies When you say my name Well, I know that you mean it My God, my heart's on fire When I'm tingled in your hand Can't sleep but I'm too tired How come you're never there? Just give me one good reason Why we should fall in line You're changing like the seasons We're running out of time What are you afraid of? It's so hard to get away Would you give me a sing? Don't you give me your lies The way you say my name It's so hard to get away Won't you give me a sing? Don't you give me your lies When you say my name Well, I know that you mean it Shout, shout, shout together Stay, stay, stay forever Shout, shout, shout together Stay, stay, stay forever Chicagoland Take me home Chicagoland Come on and take me home Shout, shout, shout together Stay, stay, stay forever Shout, shout, shout together Stay, stay, stay forever"

How could you say I left you waiting upon a shelf? Because it's dangerous, the shot so bright under a lightning How could you say this was your home? But tonight we're all believers And I fell alright with all of my heart Tonight we're all believers And I feel alright as long as you are"

They say it's getting better I can feel it in my bones Oh, the sanity is on the line Oh, I should've gone, I should've known That you're out of sight, out of mind But I can't afford to lose the spot Or you're keeping all in the dark Now I'm fading like a photograph I'm too scared that you're all I have 'Cause I know you Oh, it's been a week since I fell apart They say it's getting better But if this is the end, then when was the start? They say it's getting better They say it's getting better They say it's getting better 'Cause I know you But do you know me? 'Cause I know you Oh, it's been a week since I fell apart They say it's getting better But if this is the end, then when was the start? They say it's getting better They say it's getting better They say it's getting better 'Cause I know you I know, I know, I know But do you know me? You know, you know, you know Do you know me?"

What is on your mind? Never felt so condescending but now That all the secrets are coming out I can see what it's all about I can see that it's all, it's all, it's all around so Take my burning heart Just stay the night, and I'll keep my promise But every single day that passes by is making me more dishonest There's too much I make up, as soon as I wake up There's too much I make up for me Decided to keep you out of all The lies and see the way you are x3 Take my burning heart Just stay the night, and I'll keep my promise But every single day that passes by is making me more dishonest There's too much I make up, as soon as I wake up There's too much I make up for me"
